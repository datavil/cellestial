# Principles

Cellestial is built on 4 main principles:
1. Simplicity  
    - Simple and memorable function names.
    - No additional classes.
2. Predictability
    - Function retuns types are fixed ergo predictable.
3. Customizability
    - Plots are very customizable.
    - Layers can be added/overwritten later.
4. Interactivity
    - Plots are interactive HTML widgets that can be rendered to a static image.
    - Zooming, panning, hovering to see tooltips, etc.

## Naming

### Plotting Functions (Simplicity)

This is already a plotting library, Function names should not include "plot" suffix/prefix

e.g., instead of `plot_scatter` use `scatter`,
e,g., instead of `plot_violin` use `violin`

## Explicit over Implicit 

Function names, variable names including the constants should have short but explicit and descriptive names.

e.g., instead of `vlnplot` use `violin`


### Multi vs Single Plotting Names (Predictability)

in the case of multi-plots, functions should change to plural form. e.g., `scatter` to `scatters`

ensures that;
- multi-plots returns a `SupPlotsSpec` i.e. grid object.
- single plots returns a singular`PlotSpec` object.

## Generalized vs Specific Plots

For example `umap` plot is a subset of `dimension` plot. 


## Abstractions (Customizability)

Abstractions should be done **modarately**. they come with cost in the form of **reduction** in *customizability* and *flexibility*.

Plots already return customizable plot objects, So layers can be added later and existing layers can be customized by the user.

Rather than taking everything as an argument, accept only non-customizable parts of the plot.
--- Expections can be made for user very common layers (e.g., the geom size, color, etc.)

e.g., do not take plot size as it can later be changed by the user with `+(ggsize)`.

1. It limits options.
2. Users can always change/add the layer themselves.

### Multi-Plot Abstractions

For multi-plots though, layers (e.g `scale_color/fill_*`) can be taken as `layers: list | iterable`. 

Since, gggrid is not customizable in terms of color.

multi-plots should take keyword arguments for the ggrid as the standard keyword arguments.

`kwargs` should be reserved for geom keyword arguments.
e.g., `**violin_kwargs`


## General Syntax

Python conventions should be followed.

### Styling and Formatting

Use __Ruff__ for formatting and linting and sorting imports.

### No need for classes

This project already uses `lets_plot` objects, there is no need for additional classes.
